# TabRL Session Context Transfer

## Current Status
We're finalizing the TabRL platform with Modal GPU training integration. The main backend and training pipeline are working, but we're debugging some issues with the Gemini endpoint and preparing for real Modal training runs.

## Recent Work Completed
1. **Modal Training Integration**: 
   - Fixed `env_cls` undefined bug in video rendering
   - Updated backend to use `modal.Function.from_name()` for deployed app
   - Modal app name: "tabrl-custom-reward-training"

2. **API Endpoints Fixed**:
   - `/api/training/start` - Uses real Modal GPU training
   - `/api/training/status/{job_id}` - Tracks progress
   - `/api/training/approaches` - Fixed validation errors

3. **Test Scripts Created**:
   - `test_reward.py` - Tests full training pipeline
   - `backend/test_gemini.py` - Tests Gemini specifically

## Next 3 Critical Tasks

### 1. Fix Gemini Test Script (IMMEDIATE)
The test script has a KeyError on 'type'. Need to update it:
```python
# Change line 42 from:
print(f"Type: {approach['type']}")
# To:
print(f"Reward Code Length: {len(approach.get('reward_code', ''))}")
```

### 2. Run Real Modal Training Test
Once backend is stable:
```bash
cd /Users/ad_p_/Projects/tabrl-container/tabrl
uv run python test_reward.py
```
This will:
- Start a real Modal GPU training job
- Generate a video of the trained policy
- Return model path, video path, and metadata

### 3. Frontend Video Display Integration
After successful training, update frontend to:
- Poll `/api/training/status/{job_id}` for progress
- Display the generated video from `result.video_path`
- Show training metrics (final return, training time)

## Key Files to Reference
1. `/backend/modal_custom_reward_training.py` - Fixed video rendering (line 340-350)
2. `/backend/app.py` - Training endpoints (line 150-240)
3. `/test_reward.py` - Full training test
4. `/frontend/src/components/TrainingPageV2.jsx` - Needs video display

## Environment Setup
- Modal app deployed as "tabrl-custom-reward-training"
- Backend running on localhost:8000
- Using JAX/Brax for training
- 7-minute GPU training on Modal H100

## Known Issues
1. Gemini might be returning mock data - need to verify with test
2. Frontend doesn't yet display training videos
3. Need to handle concurrent training jobs

## Commands to Resume
```bash
# Start backend
cd /Users/ad_p_/Projects/tabrl-container/tabrl
uv run python -m backend.app

# Test training
uv run python test_reward.py

# Test Gemini specifically  
uv run python backend/test_gemini.py
```

## Success Criteria
- Real Modal GPU training completes in ~7 minutes
- Video file generated and saved to `/workspace/models/`
- Frontend displays training progress and final video
- All 3 LLM models (Claude, O3, Gemini) generate unique reward functions
